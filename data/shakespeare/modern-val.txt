now , you lie there on the path
she said if she were interested in someone , it would be someone who looked like me
besides , she treats me more respectfully than the other servants
what 's the obvious conclusion from that ?
just think , i could be count malvolio !
lady strachy married her wardrobe manager
i would send seven of my servants to go get him
while i waited , i would frown impatiently , and perhaps wind my watch , or play with my—with some expensive piece of jewelry i happen to be wearing
i ca not let my lips say his name ; “ no man must know ”
no man must know ” what comes after that ?
no man must know ” what if this someone were you , malvolio ?
but silence , like a knife , cuts open my heart with strokes that draw no blood
rules my life ” hmm , let me see , let me see , let me see
i may command the one i love ” well , she commands me
why , anyone can see what this means
there 's no ambiguity here
if only i could somehow relate them to me !
you seem to be a good person , captain , and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside , i believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners
please—and i will pay you plenty for this—help me conceal my identity , and find me the right disguise so i can look the way i want
i want to be this duke 's servant
you will introduce me to him as a eunuch
you wo not be wasting your time , because i really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music , so he will be happy to have me in his service
you can be a eunuch , but i will be mute
i swear on my life i wo not tell your secret
thank you
show me the way
m ” —malvolio
m ” —why , that 's the first letter in my name
but if i shake it up a little it will work , because every one of those letters is in my name
but wait , there 's some prose after her poem
if this letter falls into your hands , think carefully about what it says
by my birth i rank above you , but do not be afraid of my greatness
some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them
your fate awaits you
accept it in body and spirit
to get used to the life you will most likely be leading soon , get rid of your low-class trappings
go ahead
goodbye
signed , she who would be your servant , the fortunate unhappy ” this is as clear as sunlight in an open field
i will do it
i will be vain and proud , i will read up on politics , i will insult sir toby , i will get rid of my lower-class friends , and i will be the perfect man for her
i know i am not fooling myself , or letting myself get carried away by my imagination , because every clue points to the fact that lady olivia loves me
she did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently , and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs
oh , i thank my lucky stars , i am so happy
for her i will be strange and condescending , and i will put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away
thank god and my horoscope !
here 's a postscript !
you must have figured out who i am
if you love me , let me know by smiling at me
you are so attractive when you smile
please smile whenever you are near me , my dearest darling ”
dear god , thank you !
i will do everything she wants me to do
i would not have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds , to be paid by the shah of persia
i could marry that maria for thinking this up
so could i
and i would not ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one
neither would i
here she comes , the brilliant fool-catcher
may i kiss your feet ?
and i too ?
shall i be your slave ?
me too
you have made him so delusional he will go crazy when he learns the truth
did it really work ?
like medicine for a sick man
if you want to watch , follow me
i would follow you to the gates of hell , you sneaky little devil !
i will come too
god bless you , my friend , and your music too
do you make your living by playing that drum ?
no , sir , i live by the church
oh , you are a clergyman ?
you could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him , or that the church is supported by your drum because it “ stands by ” your drum
you are right , sir
what a wonderful time to be alive !
that 's true
that 's why i wish my sister did not have a name , sir
why , man ?
well , her name 's a word , and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore
why do you say that ?
honestly , sir , i would need to use words to explain why , and since words are so unreliable and false , i would rather avoid using them in a serious discussion
i bet you are a happy fellow who does not care about anything
you are wrong , sir , i do care about something
but i will admit i do not care for you
if that means i do not care about anything , you should disappear right now , since you are nothing
are not you lady olivia 's fool ?
no , sir
i saw you at count orsino 's recently
i am everywhere
i think i saw you there , you wise man
wait , here 's a coin for you
next time god sends out a shipment of hair , i hope he gives you a beard !
oh , i know
yes , if you kept them together and invested them
my lady olivia 's inside , sir
i will tell them where you come from , though i do not know who you are or what you want
i would say i was “ out of my element , ” but that phrase is overused , so i will say i am “ out of my air ”
this guy 's wise enough to play the fool , and only clever people can do that
and he does not let go of his target when a distraction appears
hello , sir
hello to you too , sir
i am headed for your niece , sir
she 's the reason i am here
taste your legs , sir
please go inside
i mean please go into the house , sir
i will
but now we do not have to !
oh , beautiful and accomplished lady , may the heavens rain odors upon you !
my message is not for anyone else to hear , my lady
it 's only for your willing and receptive ear
close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message
give me your hand , sir
i give you my obedience and my humble service , madam
what 's your name ?
cesario is my name—your servant 's name—fair princess
my servant !
the world 's gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments
as for him , i never think about him
as for his thoughts , i wish he would think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time
madam , i have come here to try to make you like him
oh , please , i am begging you , do not mention him again
my dear lady— please let me say something , i am begging you
after you cast your magic spell on me last time , i sent you a ring
what else could you possibly think of me ?
what 's wrong with my niece ?
for god 's sake , sir toby , you have got to come home earlier at night
my lady olivia , your niece , disapproves of your late-night partying
well , she can get used to it
keep myself ?
they are good enough to drink in , and so are these boots
if they are not , they can go hang themselves by their own laces !
who , sir andrew aguecheek ?
yes , that 's the one
he 's as
have not you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger ?
for someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough
so let me hear what you have to say
i feel sorry for you
that 's a step in the direction of love
no , not at all
it 's much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one
i wish you all the best
you do stay , please , tell me what you think of me
i think you are denying what you really are
if that 's true , i think the same thing about you
i wish you were what i wanted you to be !
would it be better if i were that , instead of what i am ?
i wish i were something better , because right now i am a big fool
so goodbye , my lady
no , i wo not stay a second longer
why are you leaving , my angry friend ?
yes , you have to tell us why , sir andrew
well , because i saw your niece olivia treat the count 's messenger better than she 's ever treated me
i saw it in the orchard
did she see you there the whole time , old boy ?
tell me that
yes , she saw me quite clearly
well , that proves she 's in love with you
are you trying to make fun of me ?
no , i will prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument
and you ca not deny evidence and argument—they have been around since noah 's ark
she flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you , fire up your passions , and make you angry and jealous
you should have run up to her , unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot , and rendered the young man speechless
that 's what she was expecting , and you let her down
i will have to do something courageous then , because i hate intrigue
i would rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots
well then , improve your situation with a show of courage
challenge the count 's young servant to a fight
hurt him in eleven different places
my niece olivia will notice , and let me tell you , no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage
it 's really the only way , sir andrew
will either of you give him the message that i am challenging him to a duel ?
go ahead and write it down
be pointed and brief
it does not need to be witty as long as it 's eloquent and imaginative
go on
this precious little guy is putty in your hands , sir toby
his letter 's going to be hilarious
but you are not going to deliver it , are you ?
never trust me again if i do not
and by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it
i do not think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight
here comes my little bird
listen , if you want a good laugh—and i mean a side-splitting one—then follow me
he 's wearing yellow stockings
with crisscrossed laces ?
oh , he looks like a pathetic sunday school teacher
he smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the east indies
you have never seen anything like it
i can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him
i know that my lady 's going to end up hitting him
and when she does , he will imagine she 's flirting with him
come on , take us to him
i could not stay behind after you left
my friend antonio , all i can say is thank you
anyway , what should we do ?
should we go see the sights in the town ?
you probably killed a lot of his men ?
the whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them—which most of our city did , for the sake of friendly trade relations
i was the only one who refused to give back what i stole
then do not make yourself too conspicuous
you are right
hang on a minute , here 's some money for you
maybe you will see some little trinket you want to buy
i will hold on to your money and leave you for an hour
we will meet at the elephant
i remember
i have sent for him
he says he will come
it 's easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them
oh , i am talking too loud—where 's malvolio ?
he 's very serious , which is right for someone in mourning like me
where is malvolio ?
he 's coming , madam ; but he 's acting very strangely
he must be possessed by the devil
why , what 's the matter with him ?
is he talking nonsense ?
no , he just smiles
you should have a guard nearby if he comes in here , because he 's clearly disturbed
ask him in here
i am as crazy as he is , if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent
what 's going on , malvolio ?
hello , sweet lady
why , he has an income of three thousand ducats a year
he 's a fool and a spendthrift
you should not talk about him like that !
anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage
who said that ?
the same people who say he gets drunk with you every night
we only drink toasts to my niece
i will drink to her as long as there 's a hole in my throat and booze in illyria
anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum
sir toby belch !
how are you , sir toby belch ?
sweet sir andrew !
you are smiling ?
i sent for you about a sad occasion
sad , my lady !
i could be sad if i wanted to be
these crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit , but who cares ?
as the sonnet says , “ if you please one special person , you please everyone who matters ” why , what 's going on ?
what 's the matter with you ?
my legs may be yellow , but i do not feel blue
it was addressed to him , and orders must be obeyed
i think we know whose fancy handwriting that was
do not you think you should go to bed , malvolio ?
to bed !
how are you feeling , malvolio ?
you are asking me !
noble people do not answer to peasants !
why are you acting so brazen toward my lady ?
do not be afraid of greatness ” that was well written
what do you mean by that , malvolio ?
some are born great— ”
what ?
some achieve greatness— ” what are you saying ?
and some have greatness thrust upon them ” heaven help you !
remember who liked your yellow stockings— ” your yellow stockings ?
and wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs ” crisscrossed ?
go ahead
madam , count orsino 's young messenger has returned
i will go to him
maria , take care of this poor fellow here
where 's my cousin toby ?
have some of my servants take care of malvolio
i would give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him
oh ho !
look at me now !
this is just what the letter said
get rid of your low-class trapping , ” she said
i have got her now , but i have got god to thank for it !
and when she left just now , she said “ take care of this poor fellow here ” fellow ! ” not “ malvolio , ” not anything referring to my low station in life , but “ fellow ” everything 's going perfectly
nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes
well , god is responsible for that , not me , and he deserves thanks
i do not care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him , i still want to speak to him
here he is , here he is
how are you , sir ?
go away
let me enjoy my privacy
go away
ah-ha !
does she ?
do you even know what you are talking about ?
sure thing , we will do it tomorrow morning
my lady would never want to lose him
what are you saying , mistress ?
oh , lord !
gentleness is the only way to go—gently , gently
the devil inside him is rough , but we ca not treat it roughly
sir !
yes , dear little chick , come along with me—shut up , man !
you are serious enough to know not to play games with satan
damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil !
get him to say his prayers , sir toby , get him to pray
my prayers , you hussy ?
go hang yourselves , all of you !
you are all lazy and shallow
i am not like you
you will know more about it later
is it possible ?
if this were a play , i would complain it was unrealistic
he 's really taken this prank to heart
no , follow him now , before he divulges the prank and ruins everything
wow , we are really going to drive him crazy
the house will be so much quieter
come on , let 's put him in a dark room and tie him up
my niece already thinks he 's insane
here 's more insanity for us
is it that aggressive ?
yes , it is , i think
just read it
give it to me
that 's a good thing to put in—it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law
nice and short and full of good sense—or should i say nonsense ?
good
you still have not said anything incriminating
good
andrew aguecheek ”
if this letter does not make him fight , i do not know what will
i will give it to him
you might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now
he 's conducting some business with my lady , and sooner or later he will leave
go , sir andrew
look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff 's deputy
now go !
do not worry about me not swearing enough
the fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece olivia confirms this
so this letter , which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant , is not going to scare him at all
he will just think an idiot wrote it
but i will deliver sir andrew 's challenge by word of mouth , describing sir andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that sir andrew is furious , impetuous , and a skilled fighter ( he will believe me because he 's young )
this will make them both so afraid that they will kill each other just by looking at each other
here comes the messenger with your niece
leave them alone until he sets off home , and then follow him
meanwhile , i will think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge
my lord acts just as crazy with love as you do
here , take this piece of jewelry
there 's a picture of me inside
do not refuse it
it wo not annoy you like me , because it does not have a voice
and i beg you , please come here again tomorrow
what could you possibly ask of me that i would not give you , as long as it did not damage my honor and self-respect ?
nothing , except your true love for my lord
how could i honorably give him what i have already given you ?
i will give it back to you
just come again tomorrow
good-bye
a devil like you could lead me to hell
hello , sir
hello to you
you would better think up a way to defend yourself
i do not know what you have done to upset him , but someone has challenged you to a duel
draw your sword and get on your toes , because your assailant is quick , skillful , and deadly
there must be some mistake , sir
i am sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me
i ca not remember anything i have ever done to offend anyone
you are wrong about that , i assure you
but who is this person , sir ?
he 's a knight
he 's killed three people , and he 's so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die
fight to the death ” is his motto
hello , sir
chat her up , sir andrew
what ?
my dear miss chat-her-up , i look forward to getting to know you better
my name is mary , sir
i was telling you to go after her , woo her , confront her
is that really what you meant ?
if you let her go this easily , sir andrew , you do not deserve to ever use your sword again
if you leave like this , my dear , i wo not ever use my sword again
do you think you have got a couple of fools on your hands here ?
i am not holding your hand , sir
i will go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort
i am not a fighter
i have heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose , just to see how brave they are
this man is probably like that
no , sir
he 's furious because you insulted him , and he has a right to satisfaction
so go out there and give him what he wants
you ca not go back into the house unless you want to fight with me—and if you are willing to do that , you might as well just go and fight with him
this is as rude as it is strange
please , do me this one favor : find out what i have done to offend this knight
it must be something i did accidentally
i will do so
mr fabian , stay with this gentleman until i come back
excuse me , sir , do you know anything about this ?
what kind of man is he ?
he really is the most skillful , bloodthirsty , and dangerous opponent you can find in illyria
do you want to go see him ?
i will try to calm him down for you if i can
i would be very grateful to you if you did
wow , he 's a real devil
i have never seen such a monster
i had a round with him , and his sword thrust is so deadly that you ca not even duck out of the way
and when he strikes back at you , he will hit you as sure as you are standing there
they say he used to fence for the shah of persia
that 's it !
i wo not mess with him
yes , but now there 's no way to calm him down
fabian can hardly control him over there
darn it , if i would guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman , i never would have challenged him
i will give him my gray horse capilet if he forgets the whole thing
i will give it a try
stay right here and try to look good
this may end without anyone getting killed
he 's just as terrified of sir andrew
he 's pale and hyperventilating , as if a bear were chasing him
come on , sir andrew , there 's nothing you can do about it
the gentleman insists on fighting a round with you , for the sake of his honor
the rules of dueling say he has to
but as a gentleman and a soldier he 's promised me he wo not hurt you
come on , get ready
i hope to god he keeps his promise !
i swear to you , i do not want to be doing this
put your sword away
if this young gentleman has offended you , i will take the blame for it
if you have offended him , i will fight you
you , sir ?
who are you ?
in fact , i would do even more to him than what you have heard him promise to do
if you are someone who gets into fights , i will fight with you
oh , sir toby , stop !
the police are here
i certainly will , sir
and as for what i promised to you , i am as good as my word
you can ride him easily , and he responds well when you pull the reins
this is the man
do your job
antonio , you are under arrest on the orders of count orsino
you must be mistaking me for someone else , sir
no , sir , not at all
i recognize your face perfectly , even without a sailor 's cap on your head—take him away
he knows i recognize him
i have to obey
do not worry about me
come on , sir , let 's go
what money , sir ?
take this
it 's half of all my money
are you really going to pretend you do not know me now ?
i hate an ungrateful man more than i hate lying , vanity , babbling , drunkenness , or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to— oh , my god !
come on , sir , please
let 's go
let 's go !
but oh , what a deceiver he turned out to be !
only really cruel people can be called deformed
virtue is beauty , but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil
the man 's going crazy
take him away
take me
i do not believe it
yet i wish i could
oh , please be true , please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you , my dear brother !
come here , sir andrew
you too , fabian
we have got some words of wisdom to mull over
he called me sebastian
with the same accessories
oh , if it turns out to be true that he survived , then that storm was kind , and the ocean was full of love !
he 's a very dishonest , puny boy , and more cowardly than a rabbit
he abandoned his friend here in an emergency , and even pretended he did not know him
as for his cowardliness , ask fabian
he 's a coward , a total coward
by god , i will go after him again and beat him up
i swear i will— come on , let 's go see what happens
i will bet anything you like that nothing will happen , once again
leave me alone
good for you , holding out on me like this !
no , i do not know you , and my lady did not send me to get you , and i am not supposed to tell you to come speak with her , and your name is not master cesario , and this is not my nose , either
nothing is what it is
oh please , go somewhere else to blab your nonsense
you do not know me
blab my nonsense ?
he must have heard that phrase describing some great man and now he 's using it on a jester
blab my nonsense !
what an idiotic place this world is
now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly i should blab to my lady
should i blab to her that you are coming ?
please , fool , go away
here 's money for you
well , well
wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation—if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years
stop right now or i will throw your dagger over the roof
no , leave him alone
i will get back at him another way
i will sue him for assault and battery , if there 's any justice in illyria
it does not matter that i hit him first
no , sir , i wo not let you go
come on , put your sword away , my little soldier
you are awfully eager to fight
come on
i will get free of you
what are you going to do now ?
if you insist on trying my patience any further , then take out your sword right now
what ?
because then i would have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood
stop , sir toby !
i order you to stop !
madam !
are you always going to be like this ?
get out of my sight ! —dear cesario , please do not be offended—get out of here , you barbarian !
you have to come with me
please do not say no
damn that toby !
he made my heart leap for you
why , sweetheart ?
your hand is well , i hope so
i am not such an idiot that i ca not keep my hands dry
but i do not get it—what 's the joke ?
just a bit of my dry humor , sir
are you always so funny ?
but oops , when i let go of your hand , i let go of the biggest joke of all
sir , you need a drink
when has anyone ever put you down like that
never
sometimes i think i am no smarter than average
if this is a dream , let me keep on sleeping !
come with me , please
i wish you would do what i ask !
madam , i will
oh , say it , and mean it !
no , i am telling you , put on this robe and beard
make him think you are sir topas the priest
be quick
meanwhile , i will get sir toby
here come the conspirators
god bless you , mr
priest
go to him , sir topas
the fool 's a good actor
a good fool
sir topas , sir topas , good sir topas , please go find my lady olivia— get out , demon !
why are you bothering this poor man !
ca not you talk about anything besides ladies ?
you should be ashamed of yourself , satan , you liar !
i am being gentle with you , because i am one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself
you call this house dark ?
dark as hell , sir topas
but it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls , and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal
but you are still complaining of darkness and a bad view ?
i am not insane , sir topas
i am telling you , this house is dark
you are wrong , you madman
there 's no darkness except ignorance , and you are more ignorant than the egyptians during the plague of fog
i tell you , this house is as dark as ignorance
i am no more insane than you are , and i will prove it
ask me any commonsense question
what was the philosopher pythagoras 's belief about wild birds ?
that our grandmother 's soul could end up inhabiting a bird
what do you think of his belief ?
i respect the soul very much , so i disagree with his belief
well then , goodbye
stay in the dark
i will only admit that you are sane when you agree with pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother 's soul
goodbye
sir topas , sir topas !
the brilliant sir topas !
i can do anything !
you could have done this without your beard and gown
he could not see you
now talk to him in your own voice , and tell me how he is
i wish this trick would be over
i am in so much trouble with my niece that it would not be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion
come to my room later on
fool !
fool !
fool , i say !
good fool , good jester , i will make it worth your while if you get me a candle , and a pen , ink and paper
you have my word as a gentleman that i will always be grateful to you
master malvolio ?
yes , good fool
as sane as me ?
then you really are insane , if you are no saner than a fool
sir topas !
fool , fool , hey , fool !
please , sir , be quiet
what do you want to say , sir ?
be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper
i tell you , i am as sane as any man in illyria
if only you were , sir
i swear i am
get me some ink , paper , and a candle
you will get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before
i will help you
but tell me honestly , are you sure you are not insane ?
or are you just pretending ?
believe me , i am not
i am telling the truth
i will never believe a madman until i can see his brains
but i will get you a candle and paper and ink
fool , i will repay you for this favor
please , hurry
this is the air , that 's the glorious sun
where 's antonio , then ?
i did not find him at the elephant
but he would been there before me , and they told me he would gone out looking for me
i could really use his advice right now
there 's something going on that 's not what it seems
but here she comes
i will follow the priest and go with you ; and after i have sworn to be faithful , i will be faithful forever
then lead the way , father
if you are my friend , you will let me see his letter
dear mr fabian , do me another favor first
anything
do not ask to see this letter
my friends , are you all lady olivia 's servants ?
yes , sir , we are part of her entourage
i know you
how are you , my friend ?
i am better off because of my enemies , and worse off because of my friends
you are better off because of your friends
no , sir , worse off
how can that be ?
by the way , i am going home tomorrow , sir toby
what does you would have a great hairstyle if you had
why , would that have fixed my hair ?
oh , no question—it wo not style itself
but my hair looks good anyway , does not it ?
it looks great
it hangs like an old worn-out mop
listen , i am going home tomorrow , sir toby
that duke who lives nearby is courting her
i have heard her say that
so cheer up , there 's still hope for you , man
well , my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot , while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that i am an idiot
my enemies help me understand myself better , which is an advantage , and my friends help me lie about myself , which is a disadvantage
so if four negatives make two affirmatives , i am worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes
that 's excellent
do not say that—unless you want to be one of my friends
that 's a nice hand you dealt me
but if it 's not double-dealing , sir , i wish you would deal me another
oh , you are a naughty one , encouraging double-dealing
well , i will commit the sin of double-dealing , and deal you a second coin
here it is
and maybe a third ?
the three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing , and the church bells chime—one , two , three
you ca not get any more money out of me right now
if you tell your lady i am here to speak with her , and bring her out with you when you come back , you might make me more generous
well then , sing a lullaby to your generosity : it will nap until i come back
but do not think i am doing this because i am greedy
i will be back soon to wake up your generosity
here comes the man who rescued me , sir
i remember his face well
though the last time i saw him it was black from the smoke of war
he was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small
orsino , this is the same antonio who took the
but then he said strange things to me
i do not know what else it could be
but you are a famous pirate !
orsino , sir , please do not call me those names
i was never a thief or a pirate , though i admit i was your enemy for good reasons
i rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning
he was a wreck , almost past hope
i saved his life and gave him my love , without reservation
how is that possible ?
ah , the countess is coming !
an angel is walking on earth
what can i give you that you want , my lord , except the one thing you ca not have ?
cesario , you missed your appointment with me
madam ?
dearest olivia— what do you have to say for yourself , cesario ? —my lord , please— my lord wants to speak
it 's my duty to be quiet
are you still so cruel ?
i am still so faithful , my lord
what , faithful to being mean and nasty ?
i breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered—what more am i supposed to do ?
you can do whatever you want as long as it 's socially appropriate
come with me , boy
and i would die a thousand deaths cheerfully , if it made your life easier
where 's cesario going ?
that 's the truth
who tricked you ?
who treated you badly ?
have you completely forgotten ?
has it been so long ?
call the priest
go where , my lord ? —cesario , my husband , stay here
husband ?
yes , husband
can he deny it ?
are you her husband , boy ?
no , my lord , not me
but do not be afraid , cesario
be the person you know you are , and you will be as powerful as this person you fear
oh , hello , father !
father , could i please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man ?
my lord , i swear to you— oh , do not swear !
keep a little bit of honesty , even if you are afraid
for the love of god , call a doctor !
sir toby needs help right away
what 's the matter ?
he cut my head and gave sir toby a bloody head , too
for the love of god , help us !
i would give forty pounds to be safe at home right now
who did this , sir andrew ?
the count 's messenger , cesario
we thought he was a coward , but he fights like a devil
my cesario ?
anything i did to you , i did it because sir toby made me
why are you talking like this ?
i never hurt you
if a bloody head counts as a hurt , then you hurt me
apparently you think there 's nothing unusual about a bloody head
here comes sir toby , limping
he will tell you more of the story
if he had not been drunk , he would have really roughed you up
hello , sir !
how are you ?
it does not matter how i am : he hurt me , and that 's that
oh , he 's drunk , sir toby , for a whole hour now
his eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning
then he 's no good
i hate no-good drunks
take him away !
who did this to him ?
i will help you , sir toby
will you help me ? —what an ass and a fool , a gullible no-good idiot !
get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated
but please forgive me , darling , for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently
one face , one voice , one way of dressing , but two people !
antonio , oh my dear antonio !
i have been so tortured since i lost track of you !
are you sebastian ?
do you have any doubts , antonio ?
how did you divide yourself in two ?
these two people are as identical as two halves of an apple
which one is sebastian ?
how unbelievable !
sebastian was my father 's name , and my brother was named sebastian too
i am a spirit , yes , since i have a soul
if you were a woman , i would hug you now and cry , and say “ welcome back , drowned viola ! ” my father had a mole on his forehead
mine did too
he died on viola 's thirteenth birthday
all right , i will stay another month
ah , i am an odd kind of guy
sometimes all i want to do is see plays and go out dancing
are you good at those kinds of things ?
why do you hide these things ?
why do you keep these talents behind a curtain ?
are they likely to get dusty ?
why do not you go off to church dancing one way , and come home dancing another way ?
i would not even pee without dancing a waltz
what are you thinking ?
is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments ?
look how shapely your legs are
that 's true
why not ?
were not we both born under taurus ?
oh , i remember that very clearly !
it 's true , he died on the day my sister turned thirteen
give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman 's clothing
the captain who brought me to shore has my women 's clothes
for some reason he 's in prison now on some legal technicality , on malvolio 's orders
he will release him
i was so crazy myself that i forgot all about him
well , he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation
he 's written you a letter
i would have given it to you this morning , but a madman 's letters are not gospel , so it does not matter much if i am a bit late
open it and read it
there 's a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman
why are you talking like that ?
are you insane ?
no , madam , i am just reading an insane letter
if you want things done in the right way , you will have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice
no , please , read it like a sane person
i will , my lady , but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy
so listen up , princess
i swear to god , madam , you have wronged me , and i will tell the whole world
you have shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me , but i am as sane as you are
i do not care what you think of me
i am going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you have caused me
signed , the poorly treated malvolio ” did he write this ?
yes , madam
set him free
fabian , bring him here
i accept that offer happily , madam
is this the madman ?
yes , my lord
how are you , malvolio ?
madam , you have treated me badly , very badly
i did , malvolio ?
no
tell me why you did it
i am sorry , malvolio , but this is not my writing , though i admit it looks like mine
it 's definitely maria 's handwriting
now that i think about it , maria was the one who first told me you were insane
i promise
well , you know , “ some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them ” anyway , i was part of the trick , sir
he really was tricked horribly
go after him and try to calm him down a little
he still has not told us about the captain
cesario , come here
taurus !
that governs the torso and heart , does not it ?
no , the legs and thighs
let me see you dance
he 's only known you for three days , but he 's already treating you like a close friend
no , not at all
thanks for telling me
here comes the duke now
has anyone seen cesario ?
be loud and obnoxious
i do not think so , my lord
my boy , it 's true
anyone who says you are a man must not notice how young you are
i know you are the right person for this job
i will do my best to make this lady love you
give me too much of it , so i will get sick of it and stop loving
oh , it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets , taking their scent with it
it does not sound as sweet as it did before
love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it
do you want to go hunting , my lord ?
hunting what , curio ?
lady olivia will have you executed for not showing up
so let her execute me
how do you know ?
well , he will be dead , so he wo not see anything
that 's a lame answer
where , good miss mary ?
from soldiers
well , we all have our special gifts
but still , she 's going to kill you for being gone so long
you have made up your mind , then ?
well , go along now
you would be the funniest person in illyria… if sir toby ever stopped drinking
shut up , you troublemaker , no more of that
here comes my lady
get that fool out of here
did not you hear her , guys ?
get the lady out of here
oh , go away , you are a boring fool
i do not want to have anything to do with you anymore
besides , you have gotten unreliable
if he can not , let the tailor mend him
anything that 's mended is only patched up
a good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin
if this logic works , that 's great
if not , what can you do about it ?
i told them to take oh , what a big mistake !
please let me prove you are a fool
can you do that ?
easily , madam
i will have to ask you some questions , madam
please answer , my good little student
i am listening to you only because i have got nothing better to do
my dear madam , why are you in mourning ?
my dear fool , because my brother died
i think his soul 's in hell , my lady
i know his soul 's in heaven , fool
then you are a fool for being sad that your brother 's soul is in heaven
take away this fool , gentlemen
what do you think of this fool , malvolio ?
is not he getting funnier ?
yes , and he will keep getting funnier till he dies
old age always makes people act funny—even wise people , but fools more than anybody
i hope you go senile soon , sir , so you can become a more foolish fool !
sir toby would bet a fortune that i am not smart , but he would not bet two cents that you are not a fool
what do you say to that , malvolio ?
i am surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker
the other day i saw him defeated in a
i swear , anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester 's apprentice
malvolio , your vanity is damaging your good taste
you speak so highly of fools !
madam , there 's a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you
was he sent by count orsino ?
i do not know , madam
he 's a good-looking young man , and there are a lot of people with him
who 's talking to him now ?
sir toby , madam , your relative
he talks nothing but nonsense
if he 's got a message from the count , tell him i am sick , or not home
who 's that at the gate , uncle ?
a gentleman
a gentleman ?
what gentleman ?
there 's some gentleman out there— good sir toby !
nonsense
i defy brain-death !
i told you , someone 's at the gate
yes , but who is he ?
let him be the devil if he wants to , i do not care
god will protect me
tell me what a drunk is like , fool
he 's a fool , a madman , and a drowned man
the first drink makes him a fool , the second makes him crazy , and the third drowns him
go take care of him
madam , that young man out there says he 's got to speak to you
i told him you were sick
he claimed he knew that , and that 's why he 's come to speak with you
i told him you were asleep
he claimed to know that already too , and said that 's the reason he 's come to speak with you
what can i say to him , lady ?
he 's got an answer for everything
tell him he 's not going to speak with me
just a man , like any other
but what 's he like ?
he insists he will speak with you whether you want him to or not
how old is he ?
not old enough to be a man , but not young enough to be a boy
he 's somewhere between boy and man
he 's very handsome and speaks well , but he 's very young
he looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding
show him in
call in my maid
maria , our lady wants you
give me my veil
come , put it over my face
which one of you is the lady of the house ?
you can speak to me
i represent her
what do you want ?
what stunning , exquisite , and unmatchable beauty—but please , tell me if you are the lady of the house , because i have never seen her
i would hate to waste my speech on the wrong person , because it 's very well written and i spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it
beautiful ladies , please do not treat me badly
i am very sensitive , and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings
where do you come from , sir ?
i am sorry , but i memorized what i am supposed to say here today , and that question is not part of the speech i learned
please , my lady , just confirm that you are the lady of the house so i can get on with my speech
are you an actor ?
no , madam
but i swear i am not the person i am playing
are you the lady of the house ?
i am , unless i somehow stole this role
if you are the lady of the house , then it 's true you are stealing your role , because what 's yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself
but that 's not part of what i am supposed to say
i will go on with my speech praising you , and then i will get to the point
get to the point now
i will let you get away with skipping the praise
that 's too bad , because i spent a long time memorizing it , and it 's poetic
that means it 's more likely to be fake
please , keep it to yourself
if you are just insane , then get out of here
ready to set sail , sir ?
the door 's right here
tell me what you want
tell me what it 's about
it 's about you
i am not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash
i am coming in peace
but you began so rudely
who are you ?
what do you want ?
what 's going on ?
what have you heard from her ?
take me to the garden
who i am and what i want are a secret
everyone , please leave us alone for a moment
most sweet lady— oh , “ sweet ” !
where 's the passage of holy scripture that you are basing your sermon on ?
in orsino 's heart
in his heart ?
in what chapter and verse of his heart ?
the table of contents says it 's in the first chapter of his heart
oh , i have read that
that 's not holy , it 's heresy
do you have anything else to say ?
madam , please let me see your face
has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face ?
you are overstepping your bounds now
but i will open the curtain and let you see the picture
look , sir , this is a portrait of me as i am at this particular moment
it 's pretty well done , is not it ?
wind and rain ca not wash it off
oh , i would never be that cruel
i will write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part
but you would still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil
my lord loves you
how does he love me ?
your lord knows what i think
i ca not love him
i know he 's noble , rich , young , and with a fine reputation
people say he 's generous , well educated , and brave , and he 's very attractive
but i just ca not love him
what would you do about it ?
from that cabin i would call out to my soul
i would write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night
not bad ; you might accomplish something
but i am still fairly high-ranking
i am a gentleman
go back to your lord
i ca not love him
tell him not to send any more messengers—unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news
goodbye
thanks for your trouble
here 's some money for you
i am not a paid messenger , my lady
keep your money
it 's my master who 's not getting the reward he deserves , not me
goodbye , you beautiful , cruel woman
but i am still fairly high-ranking
ah , no
calm down , calm down
if only his lord were more like him
how strange i am feeling !
can someone fall in love this quickly ?
come here !
at your service , madam
run after that obnoxious messenger , the duke 's servant
he insisted on leaving this ring with me whether i wanted it or not
madam , i will
i do not know what i am doing
fate , do your work
we human beings do not control our own destinies
what is fated to happen must happen
no , i would rather you stayed here
at least tell me where you are going
honestly , i ca not
i am just wandering , with no particular destination
but i know you would never force me to tell you things i do not want to , so i should be polite and tell you what i can
he left behind myself and my twin sister , who was born in the same hour as me
if god had been willing , i wish we had died in the same hour too !
an hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves , my sister drowned
how tragic !
although many people said she looked like me , she was considered beautiful
she 's been drowned in salty sea water , and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again
oh , antonio , i am sorry i caused you so much trouble
please let me be your servant so i can be with you
i like you very much
i am going to count orsino 's court
goodbye
i wish you all the best
if i did not have so many enemies in orsino 's court , i would go join you there
but who cares
excuse me , were not you with countess olivia just now ?
yes , sir
i have only made it this far since i left her place , walking at a moderate pace
she 's sending this ring back to you , sir
you should have saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself
here , take the ring
she took that ring from me
i wo not take it back
you threw it at her rudely , and she wants you to take it back
i did not give her any ring
what 's she trying to say ?
i hope she does not have a crush on me !
it 's true she looked at me a lot , in fact , she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted , and could not really finish her sentences very well
oh , i really think she loves me !
creet
i am the man she wants
if that 's true , which it is , she might as well be in love with a dream , the poor lady
ah , how will this all turn out ?
what can possibly fix this situation ?
oh , only time can sort out this mess
i ca not figure it out by myself !
come on , sir andrew
and the doctors say it 's healthy to get up early— i do not know what the doctors say
all i know is that staying up late is staying up late
a false conclusion
i hate your logic as much as i hate an empty drinking cup
you are a smart guy
so we should eat and drink
maria !
bring us some wine !
look , here comes the fool
hello , my friends !
what a pretty picture , three fools all together
hello , you idiot
sing us a song
what country is this , friends ?
this is illyria , lady
and what am i supposed to do in illyria ?
my brother is in heaven
or maybe there 's a chance he did not drown—what do you think , sailors ?
it was a total fluke that you yourself were saved
oh , my poor brother !
but maybe by some fluke he was saved too
it 's possible , ma'am
do not give up yet
i was born and raised less than three hours from here
i swear , this fool has an excellent singing voice
my girlfriend has beautiful white hands , and great warriors are not ha , ha !
would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life ?
a love song , a love song
yes , yes
i am not interested in being good
that was excellent , really excellent
good , very good
a beautiful voice , i swear
his breath stinks
yes , it stinks very sweetly
should we sing a round to wake up the night owl ?
should we do that ?
let 's go for it
absolutely
let 's dance to “ you jerk ” you mean , “ shut up , you jerk ” ?
so i will be forced to call you a jerk , sir andrew
it starts , “ shut up ” i will never be able to start if i shut up
that 's true
but come on , start
you are making a terrible racket out here !
lady olivia told her servant malvolio to kick you out of the house
for god 's sake , shut up !
are you all crazy ?
what 's wrong with you ?
are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners , or because you are just stupid ?
do not you have any respect for anything ?
we respected the beat of the song , sir
so shut up !
sir toby , i have got to be frank with you
my lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you are a relative , she does not approve of your behavior
if you can shape up , you are welcome to stay in the house
if you ca not , and would prefer to leave , she 's very willing to say goodbye to you
no , good sir toby
that 's out of tune , sir
you lie
they certainly will
you are right
go and wiggle your ears !
i could challenge him to a duel and then not show up
do that
i will write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf
or i will deliver your insults to his face
dear sir toby , do not do anything rash tonight
ever since the duke 's messenger visited olivia , she 's been upset
as for monsieur malvolio , let me take care of him
i know i can do it
oh , i will beat him up for that !
i do not have any “ brilliant ” reason for it , but i have a good enough reason
that 's the weakness i will use to get revenge on him
what are you going to do ?
i can make my handwriting look just like lady olivia 's : she
excellent !
i like it too
he will think these letters are from olivia and that she 's in love with him
yes , that 's the idea
he 's going to look like a total idiot
absolutely , you idiot
this is going to be great !
it 's going to be fun , i promise
i know my medicine will work on him
i will have you two hide—and the fool too—right where he will find the letter
watch his reaction
meanwhile , let 's go to bed and dream about this
good night
good night , you amazing woman , you
she 's a fine woman , all right
she 's a good little woman , and she adores me
what about it ?
someone adored me once , too
let 's go to bed , knight
tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you
i know i will too , if it 's the last thing i do
it 's too late to go to bed now
play me some music
sir , the person who should sing that song is not here
who was it ?
he 's somewhere else in the house
you are absolutely right
i would bet my life that , as young as you are , you have fallen in love with someone
have not you , boy ?
a little bit
what kind of woman is she ?
she 's a lot like you
she 's not good enough for you , then
how old is she ?
about as old as you are , my lord
that 's definitely too old
a woman should always pick an older man
i think you are right , sir
so find someone younger to love , or you wo not be able to maintain your feelings
women are like roses : the moment their beauty is in full bloom , it 's about to decay
that 's true
it 's too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection !
who 's the ruler here ?
a duke who is noble in name and character
what 's his name ?
orsino
orsino
i have heard my father mention him
when i first heard about him , he was still a bachelor
but there was a rumor—you know , people always gossip about royalty—that he was in love with the beautiful olivia
who 's she ?
i wish i could work for that lady !
are you ready , sir ?
no trouble , sir
i like singing
then i will pay you for doing what you like
you may leave
goodbye
all the rest of you can leave too
cesario , go visit that cruel olivia one more time
tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world , and has nothing to do with her property
but if she ca not love you , sir ?
i refuse to accept that
but you have to
just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love olivia
should not she just accept that ?
no woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion i feel
no woman 's heart is big enough to hold all my love
they eat too much and get indigestion and nausea
it 's as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea , and it can swallow as much as the sea can
do not compare a woman 's love for a man with my love for olivia
yes , but i know— what do you know ?
i know a lot about the love women can feel for men
actually , their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are
my father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that i might love you , if i were a woman
and what 's her story ?
there was no story , my lord
does not that sound like true love ?
but did your sister die of love ?
i am the only daughter in my father 's family , and all the brothers too—but i am not completely sure about that
anyway , sir , should i go see the lady ?
come along with us , signor fabian
i am coming , do not worry
if i miss this , let me be boiled alive
wo not you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated ?
i will be thrilled
you know , he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when i arranged a bear-baiting here
we will have another bear-baiting just to make him angry , and we will mock him till he 's black and blue
wo not we , sir andrew ?
if we do not , it will be the biggest disappointment of our lives
here comes the little villain herself
how are you , my golden girl ?
hide behind the boxwood hedge , all three of you
malvolio 's coming down the path
he 's been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour
this letter 's going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot
